## My first blog

This is my first blog website based on VuePress 2. And I start it by applying a VuePress theme called [VuePress Theme Hope](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/zh/). It's maintained by one of the group members of VuePress Project. Here is his [personal website](https://mrhope.site/).

## Start Dev mode
```sh
# start the normal dev mode
npm run dev
# start the dev clean mode, it will clean cache and temp file before start dev mode
npm run dev-clean 
```

## Static resources  

In order to make my blog as faster as possible, all pictures are using the `.webp` format. However, the icon such as logo, is using `.svg` format.
由于目前暂未有大量图片的管理需求，因此在博客中未使用图床（图片管理系统）

部署，借助 github Actions即可正常部署，
